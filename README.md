# Revyzme
Revyzme is an AI-driven résumé analyzer built using Python and Flask. It allows users to upload a PDF résumé, then extracts and analyzes key details such as name, email, skills, and experience using NLP (spaCy). This helps candidates refine their résumés by understanding what information is being highlighted and how it aligns with job requirements.
